# Detect the real Boris Vishnevsky

Due to upcoming (depend on when you read the message) elections in Russia there was a case of doubls of one candidate,
which is Boris Vishnevsky. The whole description is here: https://therussianreader.com/2021/09/05/boris-vishnevsky-doubles/

I decided to help people to spot the real Boris Lazarevich Vishnevsky among others. For this purpose I used CNN with three layers using TensorFlow.

Due to the lack of time and pretty poor dataset I got quite good results. I suppose this project to be WIP for now.

For CNN and TensorFlow explanation big thanks to:
